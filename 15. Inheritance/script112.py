"""
A Vehicle class is given that has three instance attributes:
- brand
- color
- year

Create a Car class that inherits from Vehicle class.
Next, override the __init__() method so that the Car class in the constructor takes four arguments:
- brand
- color
- year
- horsepower

and set them appropriately as instance attributes.

Use super() in this case.

Then create instances:
- with the name vehicle and the attribute values: 'Tesla', 'red', 2020
- with the name car and the attribute values: 'Tesla', 'red', 2020, 300

In response, print the value of the __dict__ attribute of the vehicle and car instances.
