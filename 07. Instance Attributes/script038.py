The Book class is defined. Two instances of the Book class named book_1 and book_2 was created.
Then the instance attributes were assigned to these objects (using the dot notation), respectively:
- to object book_1:
    author = 'Dan Brown'
    title = 'Inferno'
- to object book_2:
    author = 'Dan Brown'
    title = 'The Da Vinci Code'
    year_of_publishment = 2003

Then a books list was created. Create a loop to list all the attributes of the book_1 and book_2
instances with their values as shown below (separate each instance with a line of 30 '-'
characters).
