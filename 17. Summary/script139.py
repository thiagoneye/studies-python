"""
Implement a class named Client which has a class attribute named all_clients (as a list).

Then the __init__() method sets two instance attributes (no validation):
- name
- email

Add this instance to the all_clients list (Client class attribute).

Also add a __repr__() method the Client class (see below).

Create three clients by executing the following code:

    client1 = Client('Tom', 'sample@gmail.com')
    client2 = Client('Donald', 'sales@yahoo.com')
    client3 = Client('Mike', 'sales-contact@yahoo.com') 

In response, print the all_clients attribute of the Client class.
